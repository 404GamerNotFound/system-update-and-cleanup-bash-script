# AUTOMATED PACKAGE MAINTENANCE FOR DEBIAN-BASED LINUX SYSTEMS

This script suite automates the maintenance of a Debian-based Linux system. 
It handles package updates, upgrades all installed packages, removes obsolete packages, and cleans up the local package cache. If required, it will also trigger a system restart.

## Requirements

- A Debian-based Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu or Debian)
- `sudo` privileges for the executing user

## Installation

(Skip this step if you'd rather perform the maintenance manually)

1. Make a `git clone https://github.com/Loiseau2nuit/system-update-and-cleanup-bash-script.git` to any directory on your Linux system.
2. Go to the system-update-and-cleanup-bash-script directory : `cd /path/to/system-update-and-cleanup-bash-script`
3. Make the install script executable with the following command:
   ```
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```
4. Execute `install.sh` with `sudo`:
   ```
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```
5. Answer the few questions asked

You're all set !

## Usage

### Automation with Cron

In case you follow the installation process, you can schedule the scripts to run regularly using cron. You'll be prompted to choose :
- an email address to notify in case upgrades are on the go. You won't be notified if nothing is to be upgraded
- a time of the day on which you want to perform the maintenance.
   
The installation script will then update your scripts and cron jobs accordingly.
System updates will be executed at the chosen time, system cleanup will be one hour after (in case any restart is needed in between).

**Note:** Running system updates automatically should be done with caution, as there's a (very) small (indeed) chance that an update could cause issues with the system, especially if a restart is required. 
Thus the notification email, so that you know when to check on your system to see if everything went smooth.


### manual

You might want not to automate the process. In this case, you can skip the 'Installation' step, then review, edit and run each script manually with `sudo` to perform system update and cleanup (in that specific order !) :

```
chmod +x system_update.sh
chmod +x system_cleanup.sh
sudo ./system_update.sh
sudo ./system_cleanup.sh
```

Beware thought, than doing so might induce a system restart, as planned in system_update.sh ! So make sure you're doing it at a time of the day when an unexpected restart won't affect anyone's work.


## Troubleshooting


The scripts logs all their actions to `/var/log/system_update.log` and `/var/log/system_cleanup.log`, so you can review what the script did at any time by examining this file.

As soon as upgrades have been detected for your system, an email is sent to the address you'll choose during the install process

If the scripts do not execute as expected, check those log files for any error messages or warnings.
